# Lenest
The internship was done at Le Nest Hospital for an online business module  
This repo contains 3 projects which are:
.Emailer
.Invoice generator
.Chart maker with disease prediction.

Chart makers and Invoice generators require an Excel file to read the information from and a Word template where they can produce the output.
The UI for both is made using Tkinter.
Emailer script fetches info through the Google sheet.
The Email script is deployed through app scripts.
